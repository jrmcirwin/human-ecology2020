## Structure

* Weekly problem sets and reading responses
* Midterm
* Final

My office hours are by appointment.

## Expectations

Recitations are for:

* Discussion of broader issues
* Explanation of questions from lecture
* Review of lecture material


# Development (?)

## Outline

Today we will address the "development" side of Sustainable Development. Two main questions to address:

1. What is development as a historical phenomenon? (Development as fact)
2. What should development be? (Development as ideal)

## Prompt

In the context of Sustainable Development:

1. What is development? 
2. What are its characteristics? 
3. When did it start as a phenomenon?  (i.e. when did societies start "developing")
4. When did it start as a concept? (i.e. when did people start talking about "development")

# Development as a Historical Phenomenon

## Development as Stages of Growth

Definition: the act, process or result of growing and becoming more mature, advanced, or elaborate.

Development as a social evolutionary concept, where societies go through stages:

1. Hunter-Gatherers
2. Agricultural
3. Industrial
4. Consumption-service economy.


Economic development was part of a broader, modernist (19th century) ideology of "progress."

## Modern Study

We can take "development" as being value-neutral, and define it as the process of moving towards a high-consumption service economy, such as the US, Europe and parts of East Asia today.

This kind of "development" has mostly occurred in Europe, North America, and East Asia. Development economics and much of economic history has been grounded in this topic: why are some countries rich and others poor?

Prompt: Why should a service-based, high-consumption economy be ranked higher than a poor, agrarian economy? On what grounds?

# De-constructing Development

## Problems with Development-as-Stages

1. Post-1945 experience has shown that societies need not go through these stages to achieve desirable outcomes (e.g. Kerala and Costa Rica);
2. Development-as-stages has been used to justify colonization, imperialism, genocide and destruction.


## The Kerala Model

Recent economic history has shown that countries need not go through these stages of development. There are many paths towards a literate, healthy society.

Key example, the Indian state of Kerala:

* 35 million people
* GDP per-capita of $3000
* Life Expectancy of 78 years
* Literacy of 96%.

Conclusion: we do not require "development" in the traditional sense of the word in order to achieve desirable outcomes.

## Historical usage of Development

The development-as-stages has been used to justify racial and cultural hierarchies: i.e. more advance societies must "lead" the more backwards.

Within societies, development has been used as a pretext for the murder and destruction of local cultures: e.g. the indigenous people of the USA and the peasantry of the USSR.

# Can we rescue "development"?

## Prompt

Is development a useful concept?

If so, why?

If not, what would you replace it with?


## Development as an Ideal

How can we compare societies? The implicit goal in development is an ordinal ranking of states of the world-- i.e. would you rather live in world A or world B?

John Rawls proposed the thought experiment of choosing between worlds from behind a "veil of ignorance."

Sen, in _Development as Freedom_ expresses living standards as (positive) human rights, what he terms "capabilities."


## Dimensions of Living Standards

* Health
* Material goods
* Education
* Civil Rights and Community
* Leisure
* Type of work
* Arts
* Nature

While appealing, Sen's capability approach does not allow for ordinal ranking of societies, except within a single dimension.


## Cultural Values

How can we compare drastically different cultures?

Anecdote: "you just want to turn Niger into Germany!"

Historical example: the (incomplete) adoption of European social norms by Japan after the Meiji Restoration.

## Prompt

Is there necessarily a trade-off between economic development and conservation of local cultures?

## Prompt

Would you rather live in the world of 1950? Or the world of today? Why?

## The Aggregation Problem

Given different dimensions, how can we construct a single-dimensional index in order to make comparisons?

One answer: make arbitrary assumptions. E.g. the calculation of HDI.

$$ HDI = \frac{\frac{LE-25}{85-25}+ \frac{MYS+EYS}{2} + \frac{log(GDP)-log(100)}{log(75000)-log(100)}}{3}
$$

where LE is life-expectancy, MYS and EYS are mean and expected years schooling, and GDP is gross domestic product per-capita.

In economics, this aggregation on the individual level is done via a utility function, which takes a large space of "goods" and maps it onto a single-dimensional ordinal scale.

## The Aggregation Problem

Given a group of individuals, how do we construct a measure of _group_ welfare, as opposed to individual? 

How do include inequality?

One answer: average. The HDI, as seen above, takes simple averages of life expectancy, years of schooling and gross national product.

In economics, the may be done with a social welfare function. For example, see the Gorman aggregation, which allows a collection of consumers to be treated as a single consumer. Another example, consider the homothetic preferences used in international trade theory.


## A note on GDP

What it is:

* The sum of marketed, final goods within a political boundary, weighted by the market prices of said activities.

What it isn't:

* A measure of national income. That would be GNI. E.g. Ireland's GDP is 20% lower than its GNI. How is this the case?

* A measure of economic activity. Historically, the vast majority of productive activity was non-marketed and therefore excluded from GDP.

## Prompt

Evaluate the statement: 

World GDP per capita is \$ 18,000 per year. By the UN definition, poverty is an income of less than \$2 a day. Therefore, the only thing needed to eliminate poverty is to redistribute income.
